Being limited to a 16x8 working area would be quite constrictive. The Deluge allows the user to scroll vertically to allow for more than eight different notes’ pitches or sounds, and scroll and zoom horizontally to allow for longer sequences and / or finer time divisions.

To scroll vertically, turn the ▼▲ knob. For synth, MIDI and CV clips, scrolling up will give you access to new “rows” of higher pitches, and scrolling down will give you lower pitches. For kit clips, scrolling vertically will expose additional sounds. Any notes already created which fall offscreen as a result of scrolling will still exist, will still sound when in play-mode, and will reappear when their row is scrolled back to.

In the horizontal dimension, let’s first look at zooming. By default, each column of pads represents a 16th-note step. Pressing down on the ◄► knob will cause the Deluge to indicate this “zoom-level” on its numeric display: “16th”. Suppose you wish to instead edit “finer” detail in our sequence - 32nd-notes. By holding down the ◄► knob and turning it clockwise at the same time, you zoom in: the notes which had previously occupied the left-hand half of the 16x8 pad grid now expand to take up the whole grid. And the notes which had occupied the right-hand half of the grid are now “offscreen” to the right.

If you wish to see those notes, offscreen to the right, you may scroll horizontally to them. Horizontal scrolling is achieved by turning the ◄► knob, but without pressing down on it as with zooming. Whenever you scroll horizontally, your scroll position is shown momentarily on the Deluge’s numeric display as two or three numbers, depending on your zoom level. The first is the bar number, the second is the beat number within the current bar, and the third, if visible, is the 16th-note within the current beat.

You may zoom in multiple times in order to access finer and finer detail, all the way to 64th-notes. And you may zoom back out by turning the ◄► knob anti-clockwise - remembering to first press down on the knob.

After zooming back out, you will not be able to see all of the fine “detail” that you created while zoomed in. Pads which “contain” detail which is too fine to see will appear an almost-white colour. Simply zoom back in to expose the detail. Tapping such a pad will delete everything it “contains”.

To begin playback from your current scroll position rather than the beginning of the clip, hold down the ◄► knob and press play.
