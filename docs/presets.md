The Deluge comes with a variety of synth and kit sound presets for you to use. The user may also create, edit and save their own. Presets are stored on the SD card as XML files - if you remove the card or delete certain files from it, you will no longer have access to these presets.

In clip view, simply turning the select knob cycles through synth or kit presets for the clip currently being edited. The current preset number / name is shown on the numeric display.

Later, we’ll cover how to edit presets’ sounds. For now, it may be useful to at least know that you may create a new, blank synth or kit preset by pressing shift+”synth” or shift+”kit” respectively.
