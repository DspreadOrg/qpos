## New top panel

For users of Deluges **produced before February 2019**, we have changed some terminology, which will clash with some of the labelling on your Deluge’s top panel: what we previously referred to as a “**track**”, we now call a “**clip**”.

Your Deluge’s “**TRACK**” button is what this manual is referring to when it mentions the “**CLIP**” button. This is simply a matter of language, and your Deluge’s user interface remains unchanged aside from the new features which the V3.0 firmware provides.

## Warning about power

Any 9 - 12V DC power supply used with the Deluge must be centre-negative, not centre-positive. Using an incorrect power supply may cause damage to the Deluge.
