The parameter knobs (the two gold knobs) control parameters of the synthesizer or sampler engine. Each has a level-meter to its left, indicating the current value of the parameter it controls. Which parameters the knobs control (their function) can be quickly switched by the row of 8 buttons indicating options such as volume/pan, attack/release, etc.

For synth clips, the parameter knobs affect the sound of the synth.

For kit clips, by default the parameter knobs affect just the sound of the currently selected row. To select a sound, tap the audition pad (far-right) for that row. If you don’t wish for the sound to in fact be sounded audibly while you press it’s audition pad, hold down the shift button first.
The currently selected sound is indicated with its audition pad dimly illuminated.

If you wish to instead affect the sound of the entire kit clip, press the “affect entire” button so that it is illuminated. The parameter knobs will now affect the output of all sounds within the kit.

Three of the parameter functions are labeled “custom” (1, 2 and 3). The function of these depends on the sound preset. Custom 1 typically controls pitch for sample-based sounds, or portamento for synth sounds. Custom 2 and 3 control sample rate reduction and bitcrushing respectively for kits or songs in “affect entire” mode, and for most sample-based sounds.

More parameters are available for editing than just the 16 that you have access to with the parameter knobs. See the chapter on the sound editor for instructions on editing further parameters or remapping the parameter knobs or external MIDI knobs to control different parameters.

Several parameter knob functions have an additional function which can be enacted by pressing down on the knob. Most of these toggle related parameters, notifying the user of the new value via the Deluge’s text display.

Parameter knob function / label
Press-down function
Cutoff
Toggles the function of the “cutoff” and “res” function to affect the LPF (default), HPF, or to become treble and bass controls (“EQ”)
Res (resonance)
Toggles the dB/octave slope of the filter between 24dB and 12dB (LPF only)
Delay time
Toggles ping-pong delay (a stereo effect) on (default) and off
Delay amount
Toggles analog simulation on and off (default) for delay. Note that analog simulation consumes a relatively high amount of CPU power, lowering the number of voices that may sound at once
Sidechain
Toggles sidechain speed between fast (synced to 32nd-notes) and slow (synced to 8th-notes)
Reverb
Toggles reverb presets - “small”, “medium”, and “large”. These apply to all reverb in the whole song - not just to the current sound
Mod rate
(Only for “affect-entire” mode for songs and kit clips.) Where mod rate and depth are controlling a modulation effect (chorus, flanger or phaser), the effect switches to the next in that list
Mod depth
(Only for “affect-entire” mode for songs and kit clips.) Where mod rate and depth are controlling a modulation effect (chorus, flanger or phaser), the “mod depth” function toggles between controlling depth, feedback, and offset, depending on the active effect
Stutter
Pressing down on the knob enacts the stutter effect. Releasing it stops the effect. Turning the knob controls the length and speed of stuttering. You can also turn it while held down to speed the short stuttering loop up and down.

The stutter effect exists only as a parameter knob function, not in the sound editor menu.

The parameter knobs may also control parameters on external equipment via MIDI CC messages if your clip is a MIDI clip.
